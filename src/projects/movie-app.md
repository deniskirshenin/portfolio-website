### Problem Solved

This is my first React project and still work in progress. It is a Movie App with search and bookmark functionlaity built with Create-React-App. API is provided by TMDB API.

### Weapon of choice

- Mobile-first workflow
- React
- Axios - for API calls
- UseSWR - to manage API calls and pagination
- Styled Components - For styles

### Problems, process, improvements

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Navigate between Home, Movies, TV Series, and Bookmarked Shows pages
- Add/Remove bookmarks from all movies and TV series
- Search for relevant shows on all pages

My process:

- Started with mobile-first layout built with styled-components
- Connected project to TMDB API and provided cards with info from API
- Added Search functionality based on API query
- Added Bookmark functionality with Context API and useReducer
- Improved API calls using useSWR

### Lessons Learned

Learned how to organise mobile-first and component-driven workflow while developing single-page app. As well it was my first React project. Learned basic React concepts and CSS-in-JS tool - Styled-Components for styling. Got familiar with API calls with Axios, learned basics of state management and Context API.

Continued development: 
- Add Footer.
- Resolve bug with search bar. 
- Planning to move project to Next.js and TypeScript. 
- Add state management tool like Redux. 
- Learn more about improving perfomance. 
- Reorganise components and implement Storybook.
- Add features like opening full screen movie card. Add tests for components.
